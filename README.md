# Setup manual
To run the project, follow those steps:
1) Install the repository (git clone https://github.com/isoldpower/diginext-test-frontend.git)
2) Navigate to the root, run `npm install`
3) Run `npm run start` in order to start dev server on `localhost:3000`.
4) **_If needed_**, change backend route at src/app/config folder

Hint: If you want to change port that app runs on, you can run `npm run start -- --env port={PORT}
`

----
**NOTE: Project won't have any practical application if [backend is not configured](https://github.com/isoldpower/diginext-test-backend)**
